Ahem... 

And just what exactly do you think you are doing?

My chops aren't that good. You're not going to find anything mindblowing here. You'll be much more impressed if you just close the dev tools now.

Thanks for stopping by.

                    </div>
                    <p>JP is from Baltimore, MD, but is currently living in Nashville, TN. There he works as a web developer at a tech startup called StudioNow. When he's not in the office, you might find him hanging from the rock wall at the climbing gym, playing drums with one of his bands, volunteering with the Nashville Rescue Mission, sharpening his tech skills at a coffeeshop, or maybe just enjoying a cold beer at whichever local brewery is the current favorite.</p>
